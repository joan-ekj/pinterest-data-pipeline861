# Pinterest Data Pipeline Project
## Description 
This data project forms part of the AiCore Data Engineering Bootcamp.

Pinterest crunches billions of data points every day to decide how to provide more value to their users. In this project, I will create a pipeline similar to Pinterest using AWS Cloud. By the end of this project, I will have:
- configured an EC2 instance to use an Apache Kafka Client
- built an API to send data to an MSK cluster which is then stored in an S3 bucket
- used Databricks to read data from AWS 
- used Sparks to perform data cleaning and computation 


## Features 
1) AWS
2) Apache Kafka 
3) Databricks
